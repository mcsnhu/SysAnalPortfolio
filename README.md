Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was for a client named Liam who owned DriverPass, a company aiming to provide comprehensive driver training services. They wanted a system designed to enable customers to book, modify, and manage driving lessons online.

What did you do particularly well?

I am unsure, this work didn't feel especially satisfying.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I should probably have been more detailed with my use case diagram.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

-Online Booking: Implemented a user-friendly interface for students to book driving lessons, reflecting the need for easy access to services.
-Flexible Scheduling: Added features for modifying and canceling reservations to accommodate changes in the user’s availability.
-Secure Access: Designed role-specific access controls to ensure users can only interact with parts of the system relevant to their needs and responsibilities, enhancing security.
-Data Accessibility: Included options for users to download reports, ensuring the client's requirement for offline data use was met.
-Automated Notifications: Incorporated automated confirmation messages for reservations, keeping users informed and engaged.
-Password Management: Provided a secure password reset feature, which helps users regain access to their accounts effortlessly.
These design choices were directly informed by the stated needs of the DriverPass representatives to make the driving lesson booking process as convenient and secure as possible. It's important to consider user needs when designing because otherwise you'll end up with a product that doesn't actually work well; the entire reason someone might come to you to make their product for them is so that you can do it well, if you dont pay attention to any of the actual needs of the user then you simply haven't done your job.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Usually I just look at whatever the hard requirements are and whatever any possible future requirements may be in order to make a system that works for the task and wont need to be completely overhauled if new functionality is required in the future. Something this course didn't really talk about is the fact that while it is true that agile can assist in making sure that a project is developed iteratively and in line with user needs, it doesnt really assist in making sure that the system won't need to essentially be completely scrapped and redone anyways if very systemic changes need to happen. Building a system with possible future requirements in mind might save you from having to make an entirely new system in the future, so a greater focus on versatility and futureproofing things may have been appreciated.
